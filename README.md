# terraform-aws-cloudshell-s3-bucket-deploy

This is my personal cloud project where i go about using terraform in aws cloud shell based. Scenario request of your team lead needing a s3 bucket deployed with lock down permissons but is needing this completed using terraform. Here looking through the repo you will see me Creating a basic terraform config file for a test bucket i used. Also in the file it shows  security permissons deployment for the s3 bucket. This is all launched and created from the aws cloud shell cli. The only thing locally created was the config file using VS code. Please read the other readme.md files to seek further detail on the operations taken place.


Also I provided steps to install terraform from aws cloud shell as this will be a pre-req before you can even deploy the needed aws resource via terraform.
